The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container .special-div {
  font-size: 14px !important;
}

.container div.special-div {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

The unexpected behavior stems from the interaction between the `!important` declaration and the specificity of selectors.  While `.container .special-div` has higher specificity than `.container div`, the `!important` declaration in `.container .special-div` overrides this specificity. However, `.container div.special-div` is even more specific due to the class selector alongside the direct descendant selector, causing the `font-size: 20px` to win.
