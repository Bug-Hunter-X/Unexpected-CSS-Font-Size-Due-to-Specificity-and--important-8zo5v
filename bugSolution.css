The most effective solution is to avoid the overuse of `!important`, which can make CSS difficult to maintain and debug. Instead, adjust the selector specificity or use a more specific selector to achieve the desired outcome.

Here's a possible fix:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container .special-div {
  font-size: 14px; /* Removed !important */
}

.container .special-div {
  font-size: 20px; /*This selector is more specific now*/
}
```

By carefully considering selector specificity and avoiding `!important` whenever possible, you can prevent such unexpected behavior and make your CSS more maintainable.
